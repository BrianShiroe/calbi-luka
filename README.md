## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This system was developed and optimized for use in a localhost environment. As such, the deployed version may contain bugs and limited functionality. Notably, features that rely on AI models are currently disabled due to hardware limitations (e.g., absence of GPU support on the server).

You can access the deployed version here: http://luka.servehttp.com:5500/

We appreciate your understanding as we continue to improve system stability and performance in future deployments.

## 📌 Description
**LUKA** is a Flask-based intelligent accident and disaster detection system leveraging **YOLO (You Only Look Once), OpenCV, CCTV, and IoT-based cameras** to provide real-time monitoring and automated alerting. Designed as a **final thesis project**, LUKA aims to enhance public safety by rapidly identifying incidents and notifying relevant authorities or personnel.

This system is built to detect road collisions, fires, floods, and other emergencies using **deep learning-powered video analysis**. The goal is to **minimize response times** and **improve situational awareness** by integrating smart detection capabilities into existing surveillance infrastructures.

## 📊 Sample Feeds and Demonstration Data

<ins>This system includes sample video feeds and data within the repository for demonstration purposes and to support report generation.</ins>

## ‼️Important Note: Mobile Notifications

⚠️ **Currently, mobile alert notifications can only be received on our internal development devices.**

If you would like proof that the mobile alert functionality is working correctly, please email us at ***mazorenej@gmail.com***. We are actively exploring and working on implementing broader mobile notification capabilities.

We apologize for any inconvenience this current limitation may cause.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up **LUKA** on your system.

💡 Installation scripts for both Linux and Windows are available for easier setup. Visit:
https://github.com/LCbalsa/calbi-luka/tree/main/installscripts

```sh

git clone https://github.com/LCbalsa/calbi-luka.git

# 2 Navigate to the Project Directory
cd <env_path>

# 3 Verify Anaconda Installation
# Ensure Anaconda is installed before proceeding
conda --version || echo "❌ Anaconda not found! Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/"

# 4 Check Existing Conda Environments
conda info --envs

# 5 Create a New Conda Environment for LUKA
conda create --name luka_env python=3.11.11 -y

# 6 Activate the Conda Environment
conda activate luka_env

# 5 Install Required Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# 7 Verify Installation
python -m flask --version || echo "❌ Flask is not installed correctly!"
python -c "import torch; print('✔️ PyTorch Installed:', torch.__version__)" || echo "❌ PyTorch installation failed!"

# 8 Start the Web Application
python app.py

# ✅ Setup Complete! Wait for luka to open automatically on web or access LUKA on http://127.0.0.1:5500/
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Existing Installations)
If you have already set up **LUKA**, follow these steps to launch the application quickly:

```sh
# 1 Navigate to the Project Directory
cd <env_path>

# 2 Activate the Conda Environment
conda activate luka_env

# 3 Start the Web Application
python app.py

# ✅ LUKA is now running! Access it at http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time YOLO-Based Detection** – Detects accidents and disasters using YOLOv11 and OpenCV.
- **Automated Alerts & Logging** – Incident reports stored in an SQLite database for later review.
- **Configurable Sensitivity** – Adjustable confidence thresholds and detection parameters.
- **Multi-Camera Stream Handling** – Supports multiple **RTSP, CCTV, and YouTube streams**.
- **Performance Monitoring** – Tracks **FPS, CPU usage, processing delay, and memory usage**.
- **Web-Based Dashboard** – A Flask-powered UI for monitoring live streams and detected incidents.
- **Dynamic Stream Control** – Adjust various stream settings to optimize performance.
- **Recording & Playback** – Provides recording of live streams. allowing playback of captured videos for further review.
- **IoT Camera Integration with Sensors** – Supports smart IoT cameras equipped with **temperature, humidity, rainfall and seimic sensors**.

## 📌 Usage
1. Start the Flask server: python app.py
2. Access the web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
3. Configure detection parameters and monitor live feeds.
4. Review detected incidents and alerts.

## 🤖 Model & Detection
LUKA utilizes a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** fine-tuned for accident and disaster classification. The model can identify:
- **Traffic Accidents** (e.g., car collisions)
- **Fire and Smoke Detection** (e.g., fire, smokes)
- **Flooded Areas**
- **Landslide Detection**

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- **Edge AI Deployment** – Running models directly on IoT cameras for reduced latency.
- **Cloud Integration** – Storing incident reports and video clips for further analysis.
- **Enhanced Object Detection** – Adding additional AI models for better accuracy.
- **Mobile App** – Expanding access to real-time alerts on smartphones.
