The error messages you’re seeing are related to H.264 video decoding issues in OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture). These errors often indicate that the video stream contains corrupted frames or that there are missing reference frames required for decoding. Here’s a breakdown of what might be happening:

Understanding the Errors
    left block unavailable for requested intra4x4 mode -1
        The decoder is trying to reconstruct a frame but is missing necessary reference blocks. This usually happens in low-quality or corrupted streams.
    error while decoding MB
        "MB" stands for macroblock (a fundamental unit in H.264 encoding). This error occurs when the decoder encounters an issue while decompressing a frame, often due to packet loss or corrupted video data.
    bytestream values
        The numbers after "bytestream" indicate the size of the stream buffer being processed. If negative or abnormally large, it suggests a corrupted stream.
